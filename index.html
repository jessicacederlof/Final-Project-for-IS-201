    *Fun Fact* Did you know that when you feel happier after listening to music, it often has little to do with the actual words that are sung, but more because of the key of the song and the chord progressions?!
</p>
    <P>Music making you 'Happy' can in large part also be because of the correlation that you have with the song or artist. For example when you listen to an artist that you deeply admire, or when you listen to a certain artit's music during a big part of your life. After a while once you finally listen to them again, you will find that there are lots of emotions and memorites tied to those songs. 
        This is similar to how smells can take you back to a certain place in time, or remind you of a certain person and remember how you felt about them or the situation assoctiated with them and that smell.
         How do we know then what the best music is to listen to?
          I asked myself the same question. Is it better to listen to sad songs when you are sad to process your emotions, or is it better to listen to happy songs when you are sad to get you out of your rutt. 
          I found that both are very beneficial!</p>
    </div>
    <p> Many anonumous sources have stated that personal meaning matters more than rules. Sometimes your “sad jam” actually makes you feel cozy or safe, and sometimes your “happy song” can feel forced. Listen to your gut.</p>
